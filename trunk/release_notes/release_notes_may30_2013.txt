Updated requirements document
Created specifications document

Comments:

Requirements document:

1. Your objective is still not complete. You should include justification for "Why do we need this app?"
2. Compare and contrast features and capabilities of other apps against "Herald!" under "replacement of legacy systems.
3. Include an Appendix with information about API and other resources that you collect (specifically, google maps API, API for contacts)

Specification document:
1. Continue to think about a good s/m metaphor (in the lines of "informer", "radar tracker"). It's not a priority but update it once you have one.
2. In the use-case diagram,google maps and recipients could be other possible actors
3. Use appropriate syntax (correct arrows, <include>, <extend> as neccessary) to associate different use cases.


Next steps (Implementation):
1. Start working on creating a user interface for various activities. Create dummy UI for every activity.Perhaps, create an activity diagram.
2. Create a template of the SMS/message that you will send to recipients
3. Start exploring on creating a content provider to interact with the "contacts list" and select a recipient's phone number

Good work on coming up with a simple user story (It's a good starting point!). Meet frequently, brainstorm and code as a TEAM!!
