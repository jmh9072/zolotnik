Added Requirements Document


Comments:

1. Change app name
2. Rewrite objectives in the requirements documents as discussed during our lab meeting (why do you need this app?)
3. Update the "statement of functionality". Give a brief overview of the app before explaining the features.
4. Research on other apps that are similar to yours and update the requirements document under "replacement of legacy systems"
