Checked in basic UI that interfaces with Android Contacts
Updated Requirements Document
Uploaded templates for the SMS messages sent to recipients


Requirements Document:
1. Include timeline and milestones for each phase (under scope)
2. "Terminology" section missing!
3. "InstaMeme" sounds good. 

Specification Document:
1. User stories are important!! Include/Update them.

Next steps:
1. Have contacts load in to your application
2. Write unit test cases for modules you have implemented so far (use user stories to identify test scenarios). 
3. Henceforth, Write unit test cases before you implement a module/scenario (specifically, for issues that you currently have)
4. Include comments in javadoc style to all java source files (This is mandatory!)
5. Include comments to .xml files. 
6. Include exception handling blocks, as necessary

Good job on SMS_message_templates. Switch "driver/coder" and "navigator/spectator" roles often. Keep up the good work!
