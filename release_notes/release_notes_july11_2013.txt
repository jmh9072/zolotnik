Updated Documents
Implemented Tests
Google Maps api progress

Comments:
1. The following is missing in the specs. document.

"Create a table in the specification document that includes the release name and number, release date, the percentage of tests passed/failed and the code coverage."

2. Do you plan to complete the reqs. document at all? (check comments from last 2 releases)

3. Try to get G.maps load into your app., and import the destination address.
4. Start working on sending sample text message 
5. Explore location services.

We need to be making more progress and putting in more time and "team work". Working just a day before the release doesn't really help.
