Updated Requirements Document
Updated Specification Document
SMS Functionality!
Added "Pause Route" Button

Comments:

1. Complete/mimic SMS functionality (use scaffolding code till you get Gmaps to work)
2. Debug permissions issue with Gmaps (the problem may or may not be permissions, but it's worth looking at permissions closely). 
3. Write raw unit test cases to verify methods related to SMS. 

Looking forward to see Google maps and SMS working for beta 0.2
