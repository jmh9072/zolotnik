Updated Requirements Document
Updated Specifications Document

Comments:

1. Req. document is still not complete
2. User story for previous release (pre-alpha 0.1) missing.  
3. Continue working on interfacing to Google maps
4. Continue to do code reviews, document/comment any code you write, start writing test cases.


I expect to see more progress on both on the implementation and testing fronts. Good luck!
